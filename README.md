# Level 1 Task 4 -Beginner control structures: If, else and else-if statements

## NOTE - AT THIS POINT WE HAVEN'T LEARNED CORRECT NAMING CONVENTION YET

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a
user.

● Create a JavaScript file called characters.js in this folder.

● Ask the user to input an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter or a number.

● If the character is an uppercase letter, output their character and “is an
uppercase letter.” E.g. “R is an uppercase letter.”

● If the character is a lowercase letter, output their character and “is a
lowercase letter.” E.g. “g is a lowercase letter.”

● If the character is a number, output their character and “is a number.” E.g.
“6.3 is a number.”

● If the character is none of these, output their character and “is not a letter
or number”. E.g. “? is not a letter or number.”

Hint: you may want to research the functions toUpperCase(),
itoLowerCase() and Number.isInteger()

## Task 2

Follow these steps:
● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a
user.

● Create a JavaScript file called waterTariffs.js in this folder.

● These are the level 3 water tariffs for the city of Cape Town taken from
here:
https://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/Forms,%20notices,%20tariffs%20and%20lists/L3-WaterSanitationRestrictionTariffs.pdf

Water Steps  (1kl = 1000 litres)    | Level 3(2018/19 Until 30/06/2019 Rand (inc Vat))

Step 1(0<=6kl)                      | R15.73

Step2 (>6 <= 10.5kl)                | R22.38

Step 3 (>10.5 <= 35kl)              | R31.77

Step 4 (>35kl)                      | R69.76

● The table above states that the first 6 000 litres will cost R15.73 per kilolitre.
Next, water consumption above 6 000 litres but below 10 500 litres will be
charged at R22.38 per kilolitre. Therefore, a household that has used 8000
litres will pay R139.14 (15.73 x 6 + 22.38 x 2). The table carries on in this
manner.

● Create a calculator to determine your water bill.

● The calculator should ask the user to input the number of litres of water
they have used, and it should output the total amount in Rands (R) that
they need to pay.
